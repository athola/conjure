# Conjure

Intelligent delegation for Claude Code. Save tokens by delegating work to other models. Keep strategy, design, and review for deep-thinking models; offload long-context analysis, bulk work, and summarization to inexpensive external LLM services with quota- and usage-aware tooling.

## Testimonial

From an AI coding assistant's perspective:

Conjure turns delegation into a first-class workflow. I stay focused on architecture and code review while Conjure routes heavy lifting to the right external model. The unified executor, quota tracking, and skill hooks mean I can suggest Gemini for million-token reads, switch to Qwen for sandboxed execution, and still keep the "why" in Claude's head.

**Concrete impact:**
 - Faster turn-around on large, repetitive tasks
 - Safer delegation with quota warnings before rate limits bite
 - Consistent handoffs via shared skills and hooks
 - Better continuity: usage logs and status reports keep teams aligned

## Installation

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

The plugin wires in skills, hooks, and delegation tooling automatically.

```bash
/plugin install athola@claude-night-market
/status
```

### Development setup

```bash
uv sync             # install deps (or: make deps)
make install-hooks  # pre-commit hooks
make test           # lint + type + security checks
```

Requirements: Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Check delegation readiness (auth + CLI availability)
make delegate-verify

# Auto-pick best service for a task
make delegate-auto PROMPT="Summarize src" FILES="src/"

# Monitor limits and usage
make quota-status
make usage-report
```

### Delegation Executor

```bash
# List services
uv run python tools/delegation_executor.py --list-services

# Verify a service
uv run python tools/delegation_executor.py --verify gemini

# Auto-select based on requirements
uv run python tools/delegation_executor.py auto "Analyze this code" \
  --files src/ --requirement large_context

# Force a specific service
uv run python tools/delegation_executor.py gemini "Summarize" \
  --files docs/*.md --model gemini-2.0-pro-exp
```

### Make Commands

```bash
# Development
make format          # ruff format + check --fix
make lint            # ruff check
make typecheck       # mypy + ty
make security-check  # bandit
make test            # lint + type + security bundle
make validate-all    # full validation including hooks
make clean           # remove caches/venv

# Delegation lifecycle
make delegate-status
make delegate-verify
make delegate-usage
make delegate-test
make delegate-gemini PROMPT="Analyze" FILES="src/main.py"
make delegate-qwen   PROMPT="Extract" FILES="src/**/*.py"
make delegate-auto   PROMPT="Best service" FILES="src/"

# Quota & usage
make quota-status
make usage-report
```

### Quota & Usage Tools

```bash
# Quota tracker (Gemini)
uv run python tools/quota_tracker.py --status
uv run python tools/quota_tracker.py --estimate src/ docs/
uv run python tools/quota_tracker.py --validate-config

# Usage logger (Gemini)
uv run python tools/usage_logger.py --report
uv run python tools/usage_logger.py --validate
uv run python tools/usage_logger.py --status
```

### In Claude Code

Use skills directly in chat:

```
Skill(conjure:delegation-core)
Skill(conjure:gemini-delegation)
Skill(conjure:qwen-delegation)
```

Hooks (`bridge.on_tool_start`, `bridge.after_tool_use`) surface delegation suggestions when tasks grow large or noisy.

## Commands

### `delegate-auto`

Auto-selects the best external service based on requirements (e.g., large context vs. sandbox execution).

### `delegate-gemini` / `delegate-qwen`

Force a specific service with optional file globs and model hints.

### `quota-status`

Shows current Gemini quota usage with warnings for approaching per-minute or daily limits.

### `usage-report`

Summarizes recent Gemini requests, token counts, and success rate from `~/.claude/hooks/gemini/logs/usage.jsonl`.

### `validate-delegation`

Checks configuration integrity for delegation limits and paths.

## Architecture

- **Claude Code plugin** – Registers skills, commands, and Gemini hooks.
- **Skills** – `delegation-core`, `gemini-delegation`, `qwen-delegation` for assessment and execution paths.
- **Delegation executor** – `tools/delegation_executor.py` provides unified command construction, verification, and execution with token estimation.
- **Quota tracker** – `tools/quota_tracker.py` monitors rate/daily limits with warnings.
- **Usage logger** – `tools/usage_logger.py` records requests, tokens, success, and duration with session rollups.
- **Hooks** – `hooks/gemini/bridge.*` recommend delegation when tool output size or volume suggests it.
- **Makefile** – Single entry point for dev, validation, and delegation workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Assess** – `delegation-core` evaluates if a task should delegate based on size, repetition, or sandbox needs.
2. **Select** – `delegate-auto` picks Gemini (large context) or Qwen (sandbox/CLI) using service metadata and requirements.
3. **Execute** – `delegation_executor` builds and runs service-specific commands, capturing stdout/stderr, timing, and estimated tokens.
4. **Monitor** – `quota_tracker` warns on rate/daily limits; `usage_logger` logs outcomes for reports.
5. **Integrate** – Results return to Claude for review, edits, and next actions.

## Configuration & Paths

- Delegation config overrides: `~/.claude/hooks/delegation/config.json`
- Quota data: `~/.claude/hooks/gemini/usage.json`
- Usage logs: `~/.claude/hooks/gemini/logs/usage.jsonl`
- Make targets reference `uv` for dependency management; adjust limits via `DEFAULT_LIMITS` in `tools/quota_tracker.py`.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
make lint typecheck security-check
make test
```
